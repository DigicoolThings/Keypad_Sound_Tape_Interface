# Keypad / Sound / Tape Interface

The "Keypad / Sound / Tape Interface" is designed to provide a Tape Interface (Kansas City 300 baud), for your Retro microprocessor creations. 

It also enables mounting the "Hex Keypad 4x5 Matrix - Ultimate Cherry MX" (available separately), to make an all-in-one Keypad / Sound / Tape Interface module, for your retro projects.

The 24 pin IDC connector is designed to connect with the same connector on the "Minimalist ECB (MECB) - Motorola I/O Card" (available separately), for simple PORT A + PORT B PIA connection. However, you could equally connect to any suitable interface. e.g. With a port for the Keypad matrix and a port for the Tape / Sound interface.

The original inspiration for this project was as the I/O interface for my Minimalist ECB (MECB) based DREAM 6800 (6809) re-Creation.

However, its use is not limited to just a DREAM 6800 re-creation! Any project that desires a Tape Interface, and perhaps also a Hex Keypad Interface (with optional key press audible bleep feedback), in a compact all-in-one module, could benefit from this Keypad / Sound / Tape Interface.
